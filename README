Credits to CodePulse on youtube. I'm basing this off of their tutorial:

"Write Your Own 64-bit Operating System Kernel #2 - Stack, long mode and printing using C code.


Refer to notes\17-10-2024.txt for build and run instructions.

Summary overview:

- \build holds on the build files.
- dist\x86_64 containes the iso to mount onto the virtual or actual machine.
- buildEnv is docker stuff for creating a build environment
- notes are my notes while coding here
- Makefile is what the buildEnv uses as instructions while building the code
- src (the code)
    - impl (implementation code)
        - c implementation code
        - \x86_64\boot has all the assembly language
    - intf
        - c interface code
