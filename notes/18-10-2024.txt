So 
- Docker is obviously an environment VM management tool to hold a build env that includes:
    - NASM is used to support compiling assembly
    - Grub is used to support multi-boot (x86_64)
    - xorriso is used for generating the ISO image
    - make is a build automation tool that puts everything else together. (HENCE Makefile)
