Started by creating the buildenv dockerfile and running:

> docker build buildEnv -t custom-os-build-env

in the the terminal.

Once that has built, I ran:

> docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%:/root/env" custom-os-build-env

Which connected me to an instance of my build.

From there, I can run:

> make build-x86_64

This builds the iso containing the OS.

Then, on a new cmd or after exiting the instance, with qemu installed and added to path, I run:

> qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso

to run the created iso in a VM environment.
